XSH Usage Reference


USAGE: xsh [-x] [-d <level>] [-f <file> [args...]]

	-x : Sets XSH to display commands after variables are substituted, but before execution
	
	-d <level> : Sets the program debug output level to <level>
	
	-f <file> [args...] : Reads in commands from <file> instead of stdin.  Optional args are passed into the file as $1, $2, $3, etc.
	
==================================================
BUILTIN COMMANDS
==================================================
	• show W1 W2 … : display the word(s) followed by a newline
	
	• set W1 W2: set the value of the local variable W1 to the value W2
	
	• unset W1: un set a previously set local variable W1
	
	• export W1 W2: export the global variable W1 with the value W2 to the environment
	
	• unexport W: unexport the global variable W from the environment
	
	• environ: this command should display to the terminal a listing of all environment strings that
	are currently defined
	
	• chdir W: change the current directory 
	
	• exit I: exit the shell and return status I. If no value for I is given, the shell should exit with a
	status code of 0. You should also ensure that any currently running processes are killed off
	before the shell exits.
	
	• wait I: the shell waits for process I (a pid) to complete. If I is -1, the shell waits for any children to
	complete. Note that you can't wait on grandchildren.
	
	• clr: clear the screen and display a new command line prompt at the top
	
	• dir: list the contents of the current directory
	
	• echo <comment>: display <comment> on the stdout followed by a new line
	
	• help: display the user manual using the more filter
	
	• pause: pause the operation of the shell until the ‘Enter’ key is pressed
	
	• history <n>: Lists the last <n> commands executed.  If n is not specified, the full command history is displayed
	
	• repeat <n>: Repeats the <n>th command executed this session.  If n is not specified, the most recent command (excluding the current repeat) is executed
	
	• kill [-n] pid: Sends the specified signal (n) to process with id <pid>

==================================================
INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================
The XSH shell is a simple command interpreter.  
When run, XSH presents the user with a simple prompt "xsh >>"
Commands entered at the prompt are parsed by xsh, and then executed, if possible.
The list of commands handled by the program itself are shown above.
Other external commands are supported, as calls to the system commands.
Normally, a command is entered, and it gets executed before the next prompt is displayed.
Alternatively, if a command ends in '&' it will be run in the background.
After entering such a command, the xsh prompt will be displayed again, while the command is executed in an alternate process
You can run (theoretically) infinite background jobs, but only one foreground job at a time.
XSH also supports I/O redirection.  Namely, output of xsh commands can be redirected as input to other commands or programs
Commands on a single line separated by | characters are piped.  The output of each command is sent as input to the command directly to its right in the line
